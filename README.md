# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
NOTES:
1) Customize your code a little!! Maybe you want to store something else? I want you to mess around. Maybe you want to store the address of the sender in an array? Maybe you want to store a map of addresses and wave counts so you keep track of who's waving at you the most? Even if you just change up the variable names and function names to be something you think is interesting that's a big deal. Try to not straight up copy me! Think of your final website and the kind of functionality you want. Build the functionality you want.

Once you're all done here, be sure to post a screenshot of your terminal output in #progress.
